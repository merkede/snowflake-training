## What is Snowflake — and Why Does It Exist?

Before Snowflake, data teams faced a painful choice: **traditional on-premise warehouses** (Oracle, Teradata) that were expensive, inflexible, and slow to scale — or early **cloud warehouses** (Amazon Redshift, Azure Synapse) that moved to the cloud but still required significant infrastructure management.

Snowflake was founded in 2012 by three data warehouse engineers — Benoit Dageville, Thierry Cruanes, and Marcin Zukowski — who asked a simple question: *what if you built a data warehouse from scratch, designed purely for the cloud, with no legacy constraints?*

The result was a **cloud-native, fully managed SaaS platform** that separates storage from compute, handles all infrastructure automatically, and delivers features that were previously impossible or impractical.

<CalloutBox type="exam" title="Exam Focus: Snowflake's Deployment Model">
  Snowflake is a **SaaS (Software as a Service)** offering — **not IaaS or PaaS**. Snowflake manages everything: hardware, software, updates, optimisation, and backups. You bring data and queries; Snowflake handles the rest. This distinction is tested in the COF-C02 exam.

  ]}
/>

<CalloutBox type="info" title="Snowflake's Unique Architecture">
  Unlike shared-everything systems (Oracle, SQL Server) or shared-nothing MPP systems (Teradata, Redshift), Snowflake uses a **hybrid architecture** — shared centralised storage with independent compute clusters. This is the key to its elasticity and multi-user isolation. The full architecture is covered in the next module.
</CalloutBox>

  question="What three things does Snowflake's SaaS model mean you do NOT need to manage?"
  answer="1. Hardware — no servers to provision or maintain. 2. Software — no installation, patching, or upgrades required. 3. Optimisation — no manual index creation, statistics updates, or VACUUM operations. Snowflake handles all of this automatically."

## Snowflake: A Data Platform, Not Just a Warehouse

Snowflake positions itself as the **Data Cloud** — a unified platform that supports multiple workloads beyond traditional data warehousing:

<Diagram
  client:load
  title="The Five Pillars of the Snowflake Data Cloud"
  description="Snowflake's platform supporting Data Warehousing, Data Lake, Data Engineering, Data Science, and Data Sharing & Marketplace — all on one unified platform with shared governance"
  altText="Five connected pillars showing: Data Warehouse (BI & reporting), Data Lake (raw data storage), Data Engineering (pipelines & transformations), Data Science (ML & Python), Data Sharing (Marketplace & collaboration)"
/>

| Pillar | What it means | Key features |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Data Warehouse** | Structured analytics and BI reporting | SQL, views, materialized views, clustering |
| **Data Lake** | Store raw data in native formats | Semi-structured (VARIANT), external tables, stages |
| **Data Engineering** | Build and orchestrate pipelines | Streams, Tasks, Pipes, Stored Procedures |
| **Data Science** | ML and Python workloads | Snowpark (Python/Java/Scala), Streamlit, ML functions |
| **Data Sharing** | Share live data with partners | Secure data sharing, Snowflake Marketplace, listings |

<CalloutBox type="tip" title="Why This Matters for the Exam">
  The exam may ask about Snowflake's use cases beyond traditional warehousing. Know that Snowflake supports semi-structured data natively (no ETL into relational columns required), and that the Snowflake Marketplace enables accessing third-party live datasets without data movement.
</CalloutBox>

## Supported Cloud Platforms

Snowflake runs on three major cloud providers. Each Snowflake **account** is deployed to a single cloud provider in a single region.

        { label: "ID format", value: "<org>-<account> OR legacy <locator>.<region>.<cloud>", note: "Both formats are valid" },
      ]
    },
  ]}
/>

<CalloutBox type="important" title="Account = One Cloud + One Region">
  A single Snowflake account **cannot span multiple cloud providers or regions**. If you need data in multiple regions, you use Database Replication (Enterprise Edition+) to replicate objects to accounts in other regions or clouds. Each replica account is its own Snowflake account.
</CalloutBox>

<Flashcard
  client:load
  category="Introduction"
  question="Can a single Snowflake account span multiple cloud providers (e.g. AWS and Azure simultaneously)?"
  answer="No. Each Snowflake account is tied to exactly one cloud provider and one region. Cross-cloud/cross-region data requires Database Replication, which creates separate accounts in each target cloud/region. Replication requires Enterprise Edition or higher."
/>

## Snowflake Editions

Snowflake offers four editions, each building on the previous. This is one of the **most heavily tested topics** in the COF-C02 exam.

## Snowflake Object Hierarchy

Every object in Snowflake lives within a strict hierarchy. Understanding this is fundamental to both working with Snowflake and passing the exam.

<Diagram
  client:load
  title="Snowflake Object Hierarchy"
  description="Complete tree diagram of Snowflake objects from Organisation at the top, through Account, Database, and Schema, down to Tables, Views, Stages, Pipes, Tasks, Streams, Functions, Procedures, File Formats, and Sequences"
  altText="Hierarchy tree: Organisation → Account → Database → Schema → (Tables, Views, Stages, Pipes, Tasks, Streams, Functions, Procedures, Sequences, File Formats)"
/>

```
Organisation (optional grouping of multiple accounts)
└── Account (tied to one cloud + one region)
    └── Database
        └── Schema
            ├── Table           (permanent, transient, temporary, external)
            ├── View            (standard, secure, materialized)
            ├── Stage           (user @~, table @%, named)
            ├── File Format     (CSV, JSON, Parquet, Avro, ORC, XML)
            ├── Pipe            (Snowpipe continuous loading)
            ├── Stream          (change data capture)
            ├── Task            (scheduled SQL execution)
            ├── Stored Procedure
            ├── User-Defined Function (UDF / UDTF)
            └── Sequence        (auto-increment counter)
```

<CalloutBox type="note" title="Schema-Level Objects">
  Notice that **stages, pipes, streams, tasks, and file formats** all live **inside a schema**, not directly under the database. This is an important detail tested in the exam — these are schema-level objects, accessed with the three-part naming convention `database.schema.object_name`.
</CalloutBox>

### Naming Objects: Three-Part Convention

Snowflake uses dot notation to reference objects:

<CodeBlock
  client:load
  language="sql"
  title="Object Naming Convention"
  code={`-- Full three-part name: database.schema.object
SELECT * FROM my_database.my_schema.my_table;

-- When a database is in use (set by USE DATABASE)
USE DATABASE my_database;
SELECT * FROM my_schema.my_table;

-- When both database and schema are in use
USE DATABASE my_database;
USE SCHEMA my_schema;
SELECT * FROM my_table;

-- Show all objects in a schema
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA my_database.my_schema;
SHOW VIEWS IN DATABASE my_database;
SHOW SCHEMAS IN ACCOUNT;
SHOW DATABASES;`}
/>

<Flashcard
  client:load
  category="Object Hierarchy"
  question="Where in the Snowflake hierarchy does a Stage live — at the Account, Database, or Schema level?"
  answer="Schema level. Stages (both named internal and named external) are schema-level objects. User stages (@~) are account-level and table stages (@%) are table-level, but named stages require a schema. Reference them as database.schema.stage_name."
/>

## Snowflake Pricing Model

Snowflake separates billing into three components. Understanding each is important for the exam.

<Diagram

    },
  ]}
/>

<CalloutBox type="exam" title="Exam Focus: The 60-Second Minimum">
  Virtual Warehouses are billed **per second** with a **60-second minimum** each time the warehouse resumes. If you run a query in 5 seconds, you are billed for 60 seconds. If you run another query while the warehouse is already running (before auto-suspend), there is no additional minimum — the clock is already running.
</CalloutBox>

<CalloutBox type="important" title="Suspended Warehouses Cost Nothing">
  A **suspended virtual warehouse** consumes **zero credits**. Only running time is billed. Auto-suspend (default: 600 seconds) is your most effective tool for cost control. A warehouse that auto-suspends and auto-resumes only costs when queries are actually being executed.
</CalloutBox>

<Flashcard
  client:load
  category="Pricing"
  question="A virtual warehouse runs a query that completes in 15 seconds. How many seconds of compute are you billed for?"
  answer="60 seconds — the 60-second minimum applies each time a warehouse resumes. You are billed for at least 60 seconds per resume event, regardless of how short the actual query was."

<CalloutBox type="note" title="Snowflake Is Cloud-Agnostic but Not Multi-Cloud per Account">
  Snowflake runs on AWS, Azure, and GCP — unlike Redshift (AWS only), BigQuery (GCP only), or Synapse (Azure only). However, a single Snowflake account is still deployed to one cloud and region. The multi-cloud advantage means you can choose your preferred cloud and replicate data across clouds if needed.

  correct="C"
  explanation="Snowflake is a SaaS (Software as a Service) offering. You access it through a web browser, API, or connector — there is no hardware to provision, no software to install, and no patching or upgrades to manage. This is a fundamental characteristic tested in COF-C02."

  question="A healthcare company needs to store patient records (PHI) in Snowflake and requires HIPAA compliance. What is the minimum Snowflake edition they must use?"
  options={[
    { label: "A", text: "Standard Edition — all editions include compliance certifications" },
    { label: "B", text: "Enterprise Edition — it includes all security and compliance features" },
    { label: "C", text: "Business Critical Edition — specifically designed for regulated industries with HIPAA, PCI DSS support" },
    { label: "D", text: "Virtual Private Snowflake — the only edition with healthcare compliance" },
  ]}
  correct="C"
  explanation="Business Critical Edition (option C) is the minimum required for HIPAA compliance. It adds HIPAA BAA (Business Associate Agreement) support, PCI DSS compliance, Tri-Secret Secure encryption, and Private Link connectivity. Standard and Enterprise editions do NOT include HIPAA compliance. VPS would also work but is not the minimum — Business Critical is sufficient."

  question="A Large virtual warehouse has been running for exactly 45 seconds when the query completes and auto-suspend kicks in. How many seconds of credits are charged?"
  options={[
    { label: "A", text: "45 seconds — Snowflake charges per second of actual usage" },
    { label: "B", text: "60 seconds — the 60-second minimum applies on each warehouse resume" },
    { label: "C", text: "600 seconds — auto-suspend default means you pay for the full idle period" },
    { label: "D", text: "3600 seconds — compute is billed in full-hour increments" },
  ]}
  correct="B"
  explanation="Snowflake charges per second with a 60-second minimum per resume event. The warehouse ran for 45 seconds, but the minimum is 60 seconds, so 60 seconds are billed. Auto-suspend stops the credit consumption after the idle period — you are NOT charged for idle time once the warehouse suspends."

  question="True or False: A Snowflake account can be deployed across multiple cloud providers simultaneously."
  answer="FALSE. Each Snowflake account is tied to exactly one cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) and one region. To have Snowflake in multiple clouds or regions, you need separate accounts and use Database Replication (Enterprise Edition+) to synchronise data between them."
