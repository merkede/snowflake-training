## Introduction to Snowflake Architecture

Snowflake's architecture is fundamentally different from traditional data warehouses. It uses a **hybrid architecture** that combines the benefits of both shared-disk and shared-nothing architectures.

### Three-Layer Architecture

Snowflake's architecture consists of three distinct layers:

1. **Database Storage Layer**
2. **Query Processing Layer (Virtual Warehouses)**
3. **Cloud Services Layer**

---

## 1. Database Storage Layer

The storage layer is where all your data lives. Snowflake automatically manages:
- **Compression**: Data is automatically compressed
- **Organization**: Micro-partitions and metadata
- **Optimization**: Columnar storage format

<Flashcard
  client:load
  category="Architecture"
  question="What is the smallest unit of storage in Snowflake?"
  answer="Micro-partition. Snowflake automatically divides tables into micro-partitions (50-500 MB compressed) without user intervention."
/>

### Key Concepts

**Micro-Partitions**:
- Automatically created and sized by Snowflake
- Typically 50-500 MB compressed
- Immutable (never updated in place)
- Columnar format for efficient scanning

**Metadata**:
- Min/max values per column
- Number of distinct values
- Additional optimization statistics
- Enables automatic query pruning

<Flashcard
  client:load
  category="Architecture"
  question="Are Snowflake micro-partitions mutable or immutable?"
  answer="Immutable. When data is modified, Snowflake creates new micro-partitions rather than updating existing ones. This enables features like Time Travel and Zero-Copy Cloning."
/>

---

## 2. Query Processing Layer (Virtual Warehouses)

Virtual Warehouses are **independent compute clusters** that execute queries.

### Virtual Warehouse Characteristics

- **Elastic**: Scale up/down instantly
- **Isolated**: No resource contention between warehouses
- **MPP Clusters**: Massively Parallel Processing
- **Auto-suspend/resume**: Cost optimization

<CodeBlock
  client:load
  language="sql"
  title="Creating a Virtual Warehouse"
  code={`-- Create a virtual warehouse
CREATE WAREHOUSE ANALYTICS_WH
  WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 300
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE;

-- Resize warehouse on-the-fly
ALTER WAREHOUSE ANALYTICS_WH SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'X-LARGE';

-- Start the warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE ANALYTICS_WH RESUME;

-- Suspend the warehouse
ALTER WAREHOUSE ANALYTICS_WH SUSPEND;`}
/>

<Flashcard
  client:load
  category="Virtual Warehouses"
  question="What happens to running queries when you resize a virtual warehouse?"
  answer="Running queries continue on the old warehouse size until completion. New queries use the new warehouse size. This ensures no query interruption during resizing."
/>

### Warehouse Sizes

| Size | Credits/Hour | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| X-Small | 1 | Development, testing |
| Small | 2 | Small workloads |
| Medium | 4 | General purpose |
| Large | 8 | Large datasets |
| X-Large | 16 | Very large datasets |
| 2X-Large | 32 | Massive workloads |
| 3X-Large | 64 | Extreme workloads |
| 4X-Large | 128 | Maximum size |

<Flashcard
  client:load
  category="Virtual Warehouses"
  question="How does Snowflake charge for compute resources?"
  answer="Snowflake charges credits based on warehouse size and time used (per-second billing with 60-second minimum). A suspended warehouse consumes zero credits."
/>

## 3. Cloud Services Layer

The brain of Snowflake - coordinates all activities across the platform:

- **Authentication**: User login and security
- **Infrastructure Management**: Optimization and monitoring
- **Metadata Management**: Query parsing and optimization
- **Query Parsing & Optimization**: Execution planning
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions

### Key Services

│       Cloud Services Layer              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤

```

<Flashcard
  client:load
  category="Cloud Services"
  question="Is the Cloud Services Layer charged separately?"
  answer="Generally no. Cloud services are included for free up to 10% of daily compute credit usage. Only usage exceeding 10% is billed."
/>

## Data Sharing Architecture

Snowflake enables **secure data sharing** without data copying:

- **Live Access**: Consumers query provider's data directly
- **Zero-Copy**: No data movement required
- **Real-Time**: Always up-to-date data
- **Granular Control**: Share specific objects only

<CodeBlock
  client:load
  language="sql"
  title="Creating a Share"
  code={`-- Create a share
CREATE SHARE SALES_SHARE;

-- Grant usage on database
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE SALES_DB TO SHARE SALES_SHARE;

-- Grant usage on schema
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA SALES_DB.PUBLIC TO SHARE SALES_SHARE;

-- Grant select on specific table
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE SALES_DB.PUBLIC.ORDERS TO SHARE SALES_SHARE;

-- Add account to share
ALTER SHARE SALES_SHARE ADD ACCOUNTS = xy12345;`}
/>

---

## Multi-Cluster Warehouses

For high concurrency scenarios, Snowflake offers **Multi-cluster Warehouses**:

- **Auto-scaling**: Add clusters based on load
- **Maximized Mode**: All clusters run simultaneously
- **Auto-scale Mode**: Clusters scale based on demand
- **Concurrent Query Handling**: Distributes queries across clusters

<CodeBlock
  client:load
  language="sql"
  title="Multi-Cluster Warehouse"
  code={`CREATE WAREHOUSE PRODUCTION_WH
  WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE'
  MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1
  MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 5
  SCALING_POLICY = 'STANDARD'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 300
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;`}
/>

<Flashcard
  client:load
  category="Multi-Cluster"
  question="What's the difference between scaling UP and scaling OUT in Snowflake?"
  answer="Scaling UP = Increasing warehouse size (more resources per query). Scaling OUT = Adding more clusters (handles more concurrent queries). Use scaling UP for large queries, scaling OUT for high concurrency."
/>

## Key Architecture Benefits

1. **Separation of Storage and Compute**
   - Scale independently
   - Pay for what you use
   - Multiple warehouses access same data

2. **Automatic Optimization**
   - No indexes to manage
   - No partitioning required
   - Automatic statistics

3. **Data Sharing Without Copying**
   - Secure and controlled
   - Real-time updates
   - No ETL required

4. **Zero Maintenance**
   - No infrastructure management
   - Automatic updates
   - Built-in disaster recovery

## Practice Questions

<Flashcard
  client:load
  category="Exam Prep"
  question="True or False: In Snowflake, you need to define partition keys for tables to optimize query performance."
  answer="FALSE. Snowflake automatically creates micro-partitions and maintains metadata. Manual partitioning is not required and not recommended."
/>

<Flashcard
  client:load
  category="Exam Prep"
  question="What happens to data when you drop a virtual warehouse?"
  answer="Nothing. Data is stored independently in the storage layer. Dropping a warehouse only removes compute resources, not data."
/>

<Flashcard
  client:load
  category="Exam Prep"
  question="Can two different virtual warehouses query the same table simultaneously?"
  answer="YES. Multiple warehouses can access the same data concurrently without any contention, thanks to the separation of storage and compute."
/>
